# K-Sounds Hub V2

This document describes the current V2 state of the project.

Older tranche/fix notes were removed from the working tree because they described obsolete intermediate states. They remain available in Git history.

## Current runtime shape

K-Sounds Hub V2 is the active project. The old `~/k-sounds-hub` V1 tree is obsolete and should not be used.

Current paths:

- Repo: `~/k-sound-hub-v2`
- Config: `~/.config/k-sounds-hub`
- IPC socket: `/tmp/ksound_hub_audio_v2_<uid>.sock`
- Launcher: `scripts/start_ksound_hub_v2.sh`
- Clean start wrapper: `~/.local/bin/start_ksound_v2_clean.sh`

## Main app

- Python / PySide6 app package: `ksound_hub`
- Main entry point: `python -m ksound_hub.app`
- Control entry point: `python -m ksound_hub.control`
- Main launcher script: `scripts/start_ksound_hub_v2.sh`
- Installed launcher wrapper: `~/.local/bin/start_ksound_v2_clean.sh`

## Playback channels

Visible playback channels:

- `all`
- `game`
- `chat`
- `media`
- `more`

Extra channels:

- `micro`
- `return-mic`

## Playback architecture

The native C++ playback engine is available at:

- `native_engine/build/ksound_native_engine`

The engine reads runtime state from:

- `~/.config/k-sounds-hub/runtime/native-engine/`

It is currently disabled by default while the stable PipeWire/filter-chain path remains active. It must not be described as the distributed final renderer until its stress tests pass.

The cleanup removed obsolete Python playback prototypes from the source tree. Those old files remain available in Git history.

## Overlay

The current HUD renderer source and local build path are:

- `tools/hud_overlay/build/audio-hud-overlay`

This renderer is part of the current runtime. Glass starts it through `scripts/start_hud.sh` when the Overlay option is enabled.

## Android soundboard remote

Android remote source:

- `android-soundboard-apk/`

PC web/pairing side:

- `tools/soundboard_remote/`

APK signing is local and automatic. The repo must not contain signing secrets.

Default local signing files:

- `~/.local/share/k-sounds-hub/android/ksound-soundboard.keystore`
- `~/.local/share/k-sounds-hub/android/signing.env`

The APK build script can generate a local keystore automatically if none exists:

- `scripts/build_android_soundboard_apk.sh`

Optional overrides:

- `KSOUND_SOUNDBOARD_SIGN_DIR`
- `KSOUND_SOUNDBOARD_KEYSTORE`

## Local files intentionally ignored

These are expected to stay local and ignored by Git:

- `.venv/`
- `native_engine/build/`
- `tools/hud_overlay/build/`
- `dist/`
- `android-soundboard-apk/gen/`
- `android-soundboard-apk/classes/`
- `android-soundboard-apk/dex/`
- `android-soundboard-apk/*.apk`
- `android-soundboard-apk/*.keystore`
- `android-soundboard-apk/*.jks`

## Cleanup status

Completed:

- V1 launch fallbacks removed from source.
- Installed V1 launchers removed.
- Old `~/k-sounds-hub` tree archived and removed.
- Old `~/.config/ksound-hub` config archived and removed.
- Tracked `.venv` symlink removed from Git.
- V2 now uses a real local `.venv/`.
- Obsolete Python audio prototypes removed.
- Android keystore moved out of repo.
- Android signing made automatic and local.

## Recommended PipeWire settings

For the current heavy-use routing profile, use `48000 Hz` with a `512` quantum when gaming or running voice chat at the same time. This is a stability recommendation, not a hard application requirement. The previous `256 / 48000` runtime can be too aggressive for the full virtual routing graph on some systems.
